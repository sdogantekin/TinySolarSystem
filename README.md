# Tiny Solar System

A mobile app that presents the actual positioning and movement of planets, sun, and important space bodies in the solar system. The app allows users to speed up time (from real-time to 1 app second = 1 month) and experiment with "what if" scenarios like removing planets or changing their distances from the sun.

## Features

- **Accurate Solar System Simulation**: View the actual positioning and movement of planets and other celestial bodies.
- **Time Control**: Adjust the simulation speed from real-time to accelerated time (up to 1 second = 1 month).
- **What If Scenarios**: Experiment with removing planets or changing their distances from the sun.
- **Celestial Body Information**: Tap on any planet to view detailed information.
- **Zoom Controls**: Zoom in/out or fit the view to see the entire solar system.
- **Dark Mode**: Optimized for dark mode for a better viewing experience.

## Screens

1. **Splash Screen**: Simple branding with the app logo and tagline.
2. **Main Screen**: Displays the solar system with controls for time, zoom, and accessing the "what if" scenarios.
3. **What If Screen**: Interface for creating imaginary scenarios by removing planets or adjusting their distances from the sun.
4. **Error Screen**: Handles API failures or lost internet connection with friendly error messages.
