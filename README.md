# Tiny Solar System

This is a mobile application that presents the positioning and movement of planets, sun, and important space bodies in the solar system. The application allows users to speed up time and experiment with "what if" scenarios like removing planets or changing their distances from the sun.

## Features

- **Visually Appealing Solar System Simulation**: View the appealing positioning and movement of planets and other celestial bodies.
- **Time Control**: Adjust the simulation speed from real-time to accelerated time.
- **What If Scenarios**: Experiment with removing planets or changing their distances from the sun.
- **Celestial Body Information**: Tap on any planet to view detailed information.
- **Zoom Controls**: Zoom in/out or fit the view to see the entire solar system.
- **Dark Mode**: Optimized for dark mode for a better viewing experience.

## Screens

1. **Splash Screen**: Simple branding with the app logo and tagline.
2. **Main Screen**: Displays the solar system with controls for time, zoom, and accessing the "what if" scenarios.
3. **What If Screen**: Interface for creating imaginary scenarios by removing planets or adjusting their distances from the sun.
4. **Error Screen**: Handles system errors with friendly error messages.
